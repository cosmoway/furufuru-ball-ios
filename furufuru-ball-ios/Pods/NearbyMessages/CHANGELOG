Version 0.9.7 - November 2015
=============================
Resolved Issues:
  - Nearby no longer disrupts audio being played by the app using Nearby.
  - Reduced network traffic in some cases.
  - Improved latency in some cases.
  - Display the Nearby permission dialog only in cases where iOS requires
    microphone or Bluetooth permission.
  - Improved the Nearby permission dialog to make it less confusing.

Other changes:

Known issues:

    no known workaround besides upgrading to iOS 9.  Details here:
