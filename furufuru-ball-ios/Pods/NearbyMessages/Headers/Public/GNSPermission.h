/// The user must grant permission before publications and subscriptions will work.  The first
/// time the application creates a publication or subscription, the Nearby permission dialog is
/// automatically displayed, giving the user the opportunity to opt in.  If the user denies, an
/// alert will be displayed each time a publication or subscription is subsequently created, giving
/// them another chance to opt in.
///
/// It is recommended that your app provide the user a method for switching the permission on or
/// off; for instance, by using a toggle switch in a settings page.  When the user toggles it, the
/// app should call the \c isGranted and \c setGranted methods below to toggle the permission state.
///
/// To track the permission state, create a \c GNSPermission object and pass in a changed handler.
/// The handler will be called whenever the permission state is changed, allowing your app's UI to
/// be kept in sync with the current state.
